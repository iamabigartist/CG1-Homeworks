## Statement

In this assignment, you are required to create your first graphics program using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/). As you have learned in the course as well as the tutorials, to start up your first graphics program, you will need to use [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) to create a window. By default, GLFW will create a window with double  buffering enabled. Then, you can use the basic OpenGL calls to draw 3D  objects on the window as well as manipulate the camera to navigate  through the virtual scene. To reduce aliasing artifacts, you can also  enable antialiasing in OpenGL by multi-sampling.

In the following, we will give you the  specifics about what you need to accomplish, as well as some related  guidelines in order to assist your programming.

## Submission

You are required to submit following things through GitHub repository:

- project scripts and an executable program
- a PDF-formatted report which describes what you have hone

git/GitHub, refer to the manual or post on Piazza for help.

## **Grading rules**

- You can choose to do the **[optional]** item, and if you choose to do it, you will get additional scores based  on the additional work you have done. But the maximum additional score  will not exceed 20% of the entire score of this assignment.

We fully understand that implementations could be  similar somewhere, but they cannot be identical. To avoid being  evaluated inappropriately, please show your understanding of your codes  in your video.
- Late submission of your assignment will subject to score deduction.  

## Skeleton Project/ Report Template

The skeleton program and report template  will be provided once you accept the assignment link of GitHub classroom which we published in piazza.  If you accept the assignment through link properly, a repository which  contains  the skeleton project and report template will be  created under your  GitHub  account. Please follow the template to prepare your report.

You should complete your assignment submission to your repository through GitHub before the deadline.
